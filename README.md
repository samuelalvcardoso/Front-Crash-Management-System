# Front-Crash-Management-System

Over the past 20 years, more than 800,000 people have died on the roads of the European Union.
Thanks to the joint effort of some organizations and governments, these numbers have been decreasing
due to the creation of regulations to include passive and active protection systems in vehicles. This way,
this work was developed to create a structure or several structures that protect the occupants in case of
frontal collision in order to be applied in a modular platform that will carry several types of vehicles.
Thus, for each case, the structures were developed to protect the occupants regarding the Euro
NCAP frontal full width test protocol. The structural development process was based on some geometric
parametrization and a multi-objective genetic optimization was used to find the best solutions from the
finite element analyses.


Four types of vehicles were considered. For the lighter case, a primary structure was developed to
absorb the corresponding energy during the impact. The heavier vehicles have a secondary structure
to absorb the energy corresponding to the added weight.


The final geometries have proven to fulfil the assumptions, obtaining a good relation between the
mass increase in these structures and the energy absorption during the impact. On the other hand, the
insertion of the secondary structure proved to have satisfactory effects on the overall behaviour during
the crash events.

This thesis was done with the intention of obtaining the Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering.
